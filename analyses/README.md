Thanks for viewing my project. This directory contains projects and anlysis that I performed on freely available data. The technology used varies from project to project.

* wine.quality: In this project, I used freely available wine quality data to predict quality rating. The model was built using a random forest algorithm with 11 predictors and a 6 value categorical predictor, quality rating.
