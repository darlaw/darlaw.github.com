			Thanks for viewing my portfolio.
		</p>
		<p>
			This repository contains code samples and analyses that I've perform as I journey through learning analytics and data science.
			It includes a bit of enterprise data analysis and some model building.
		</p>

			The directory contents are:

				My own analyses on freely available data. The type of analysis is dependent on the nature of the data. In some cases I'll
					go a little enterprise data analysis, and others I'll create one or more models.
					<ul>
						<li>
							Wine Quality: In this project, I used freely available wine quality data to create a model that predicts quality rating.
							The model was built as a random forest with 11 predictors and a 6 value categorical predictor - quality rating. </br>
